Oh My Posh Theme Selector and Scraper üöÄ
Description ‚ú®

This repository contains two related Bash scripts designed to enhance your experience with Oh My Posh, a custom prompt engine for your shell.

    The select-posh-theme.sh script provides a convenient way to switch between your installed Oh My Posh themes using a Rofi menu.

    The scrape-posh-previews.sh script helps you generate a local file containing theme preview image URLs from the official Oh My Posh documentation, which can be used by the theme switcher for quick visual browsing.
